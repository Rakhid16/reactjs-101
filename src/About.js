  The first question that is probably coming inside your mind is “Why specifically learn Python?” Well, the answer to this question is quite simple. Think about the factors you would like to include in a programming language.
  <b>Learnability</b>, <b>Increased Productivity</b>, and <b>High paying salaries</b>. You can choose Python for Web Development, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Scripting, Scientific Computing and so on. So just learn GoLang then!
