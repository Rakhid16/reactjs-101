The tutorials themselves may be the best in the field, but you're still not learning anything. Don't get me wrong, tutorials are nice and helpful, but to limited extents. You can't just follow tutorials and act like you own a certain programming language or framework, it's deeper and harder than that. People often misinterpret tutorials and think that by watching videos or reading an article they're learning and gaining experience, but that's not true. Watching videos or reading articles without building real-world applications that utilise what you learn is granted to make you forget just as much as you think you're learning. But is there a solution? Short answer is yes. Get out of the code tutorial now and get a job! :P But it is not quite easy beacuse you know you need experince to get a good job but in order to get some experinces you've to work (get a job).
