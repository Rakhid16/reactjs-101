        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This is my first React JS project. I made this in order to fulfill Framework Programming Assignment from Mr. Fawwaz. Get closer, let met tell you something. Do you know about <b>Tutorial Purgatory</b>?
          Ever went through a really nice tutorial for some time only to find out after finishing or at least going a long way that <b>you're not actually learning anything</b>? That's what tutorial purgatory is about.
          Tutorial purgatory is defined as the act of going from a tutorial to another <b>without practically learning anything</b>. The tutorials themselves may be the best in the field, but you're still not learning anything.
          Don't get me wrong, tutorials are nice and helpful, but to limited extents. You can't just follow tutorials and act like you own a certain programming language or framework, it's deeper and harder than that. People often misinterpret tutorials and think that by watching videos or reading an article they're learning and gaining experience, but that's not true.
          Watching videos or reading articles without building real-world applications that utilise what you learn is granted to make you forget just as much as you think you're learning. But is there a solution? Short answer is yes. Get out of the code tutorial now and get a job! :P But it is not quite easy
          beacuse you know you need experince to get a good job but in order to get some experinces you've to work (get a job). Sounds paradox isn't?

  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The first question that is probably coming inside your mind is “Why specifically learn Python?” Well, the answer to this question is quite simple. Think about the factors you would like to include in a programming language.
  <b>Learnability</b>, <b>Increased Productivity</b>, and <b>High paying salaries</b>. You can choose Python for Web Development, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Scripting, Scientific Computing and so on. So just learn Python then!
